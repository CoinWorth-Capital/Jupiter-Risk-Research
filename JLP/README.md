## JLP Risk Exposure in BTC Terms
JLP is backed by an index basket of 5 cryptocurrencies that includes SOL, ETH, BTC, USDT, and USDC. A simple beta calculation can estimate how much exposure in BTC terms the index holds- but a double-sided "Up beta" and "Down beta" can allow for a better understanding of the risks that Solana and Ether pose in BTC terms.

*This is a risk analysis, and is primarily concerned with relative underperformance against Bitcoin.*

The target JLP portfolio holdings are:
- 47% SOL
- 10% ETH
- 11% wBTC
- 28% USDC
- 4% USDT

And each JLP portfolio holding represents this amount of *downside* risk in BTC terms:
- 47% SOL * 1.323 => 62.2%
- 10% ETH * 1.128 => 11.28%
- 11% wBTC * 1 => 11%
- 28% USDC
- 4% USDT
For a sum of 84.48% of the risk in BTC terms. **Holding JLP's non-stable asset portfolio is about 85% as risky as holding BTC on the downside**.

The total JLP portfolio, is valued as 84.48% in BTC downside beta and 32% in USD stablecoin value.
For every dollar in JLP's portfolio, the BTC downside beta is about 0.84 and the stablecoin value is 0.32: 
But we also would like to know the upside!

And each JLP portfolio holding represents this amount of *upside* risk in BTC terms:
*Values are taken from the greater of 90d and 365d upside beta*
- 47% SOL * 1.124 => 52.83%
- 10% ETH * 1.415 => 14.15%
- 11% wBTC * 1 => 11%
- 28% USDC
- 4% USDT
For a sum of 77.98% of the risk in BTC terms. **Holding JLP's non-stable asset portfolio is about 78% as risky as holding BTC on the upside**.

Because the stablecoin value is 0.32 of the index, by combining the two, we get 1.0998 as the value in USD and Bitcoin of the index.
**This means that you're getting $1.10 in value per dollar invested in JLP at the virtual price.**

The current market price is around 0.58% above the virtual price.

### ETH's Beta Versus BTC

This analysis was conducted at a ETHBTC ratio of .029 which is relatively near the 52w low. 02/17/2025.
ETHBTC has been in a downtrend versus BTC since September of 2022, where it was .085 which is a consistent decline.

Results:

30d Basic Beta of Ether vs Bitcoin: 1.073
90d Basic Beta of Ether vs Bitcoin: 1.142
365d Basic Beta of Ether vs Bitcoin: 1.006

90d Upside Beta of Ether vs Bitcoin: 1.415
90d Downside Beta of Ether vs Bitcoin: 1.059
365d Upside Beta of Ether vs Bitcoin: 0.940
365d Downside Beta of Ether vs Bitcoin: 1.128

Key Takeaways:

Ether is highly correlated with Bitcoin, but over the past year has fallen more and risen less in comparison.
There are moments where the upside beta is temporarily very high.
Use the greater of 90d and 365d downside beta to estimate the market risk of Ether in BTC terms.
In this case, 1.128 is the market risk beta of Solana in BTC terms.


### SOL's Beta Versus BTC

Notably, this analysis was conducted at a SOLBTC ratio of .0019 which is near the 52w low. 02/17/2025.

Results:

30d Basic Beta of Solana vs Bitcoin: 1.402
90d Basic Beta of Solana vs Bitcoin: 1.260
365d Basic Beta of Solana vs Bitcoin: 1.144

90d Upside Beta of Solana vs Bitcoin: 1.124
90d Downside Beta of Solana vs Bitcoin: 1.323
365d Upside Beta of Solana vs Bitcoin: 1.007
365d Downside Beta of Solana vs Bitcoin: 1.212

Key Takeaways:

Understand that downside volatility is much higher on SOLBTC than the basic beta lets on.
Use the greater of 90d and 365d downside beta to estimate the market risk of Solana in BTC terms.
In this case, 1.323 is the market risk beta of Solana in BTC terms.

### Other Assumptions
The Bitcoin risk equivalent measure does not include the total portfolio value from stablecoins.
This ignores the premium between the virtual and market price of JLP.
