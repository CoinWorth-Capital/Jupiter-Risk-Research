Analysis of market risk factors for liquid tokens from the Jupiter protocol.

## JLP Risk Exposure in BTC Terms
JLP is backed by an index basket of 5 cryptocurrencies that includes SOL, ETH, BTC, USDT, and USDC. A simple beta calculation can estimate how much exposure in BTC terms the index holds- but a double-sided "Up beta" and "Down beta" can allow for a better understanding of the risks that Solana and Ether pose in BTC terms.

*See the readme in the JLP folder for more info*
